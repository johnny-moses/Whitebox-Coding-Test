# Whitbox-Coding-Test
Thank you Sean for this great oppotunity!
I was not able to match the expected output. I only found one ID equal to 1240 and only wrote one line of customer info. I also did not check what the output was supposed to look like before starting and followed the instructions as best I could understand.
I hope this doesn't ruin my chances of joining your team, but I am greatful for the opprotunity nonetheless.
