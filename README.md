# Whitbox-Coding-Test
Thank you Sean for this great oppotunity!
I struggled getting my code to connect with an SQL database for quite some time, and I hate to admit that this took far much more time than I had hoped. However, I eventully managed to get my set up working and was able to do what was asked of me.

I am turning this in as soon as I could. It is not perfect..
I queried the database perfectly for the requested client id, but my .xlsx output is not perfect.

I hope this is enough to show that I am a determined, hardworking individual that is willing to learn new technologies, and step outside of my safe zone.

Thanks again and take care! Hope to hear from you again soon!
