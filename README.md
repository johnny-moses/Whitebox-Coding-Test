# Whitbox-Coding-Test
Thank you Sean for this great oppotunity!
I struggled getting my code to connect with an SQL database for quite some time, and I hate to admit that this took far much more time than I had hoped. However, I eventully managed to get my set up working and was able to do what was asked of me.
